		Think about all the munching you have done in last one week. Grabbing a chocolate bar while walking down the store aisle or having a bucket of popcorn while binging on Netflix. Having a quick bite of energy bar before work-out or munching on Doritos just to pass the time. Snacking has indeed become a part of our lifestyle. A survey done by the <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/in/en.html" target="_blank">Nielsen</a> organization to understand snacking habits of the world concluded that nearly half of the population prefers snacking instead of eating meals. It seems consumers see a blurred difference between a snack and a full course meal.

		People prefer snacks at different times of the day only to feel full and satiated. This is the main reason for the fierce growth in the snack industry. But sadly the tasty treats are mostly carbs and calories. The highest selling snack is confections which include chocolate, candy and gum closely followed by salty snacks and refrigerated snacks

		But as people are getting more health conscious, thanks to influential media, people are looking forward to balance of indulgence and dietary snacks. Interestingly the respondents in the Nielson survey chose the fresh fruit as the most preferred snack (18%) followed by chocolates (15%) but the actual consumption is the opposite cry. In the span of 30 days, chocolates were consumed the most followed by fresh fruits. It seems that there is a mental conflict in the minds of consumer to choose between indulgence and health.

		The future belongs definitely to snacks that are healthy as well as savory. That is the reason we see Banana chips as strong contender in the snack industry. Banana is rich in potassium, vitamin C, vitamin A, magnesium and vitamin B6. Bananas are low in calories and have no fat, no sodium, and no cholesterol. Bananas are known to prevent the risk of high blood pressure and heart strokes. Additionally Bananas have tryptophan which is known to regulate mood and sleep in your body. Having bananas can thus help you fight depression and anxiety.
